# About Me

Welcome to my blog powered by **PHPMark Framework**!

I'm a developer passionate about creating simple, elegant solutions. This site is built with my custom SSR blog framework that prioritizes performance, simplicity, and developer experience.

## What I Do

I enjoy building web applications, experimenting with new technologies, and sharing knowledge through writing. This blog is where I document my learnings, projects, and thoughts on software development.

## PHPMark Framework

This site runs on PHPMark Framework, a minimal server-side rendered blog framework I created. It features:

- **Zero JavaScript required** - works perfectly without client-side scripts
- **Lightning fast** - optimized PHP 8.3 + nginx stack  
- **File-based** - write in Markdown, no database needed
- **Developer friendly** - hot reload, Docker setup, clean code

## Get In Touch

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss technology, collaborate on projects, or just say hello!
